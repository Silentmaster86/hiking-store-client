# Hiking Store — Junior Frontend Portfolio Project

A modern **e-commerce web application** built as a **portfolio project for a Junior Frontend Developer role**.

This project simulates a real-world online store and focuses on demonstrating **frontend engineering skills**, clean architecture, API integration, and UX best practices — while intentionally avoiding overengineering.

## 🎯 Project Goals

The main goals of this project were to:

* Build a realistic React SPA with clean structure
* Integrate with a real backend API
* Handle async states, errors, and edge cases
* Demonstrate production-style UX patterns
* Show how a frontend works with sessions & server state
* Create a portfolio-ready project similar to real commercial work

## What I Learned

During this project I practiced and improved:

* Designing a **realistic React app architecture**
* Working with a real backend API
* Managing global state with Context API
* Handling async loading & error states
* Building session-based cart logic
* Implementing protected routes
* Debugging API & auth issues
* Improving UX with skeleton loaders & feedback
* Working with cookies & CORS in production

## Project Scope (Intentional Decisions)

To keep the project focused on **frontend fundamentals**, the following features were intentionally **not implemented yet**:

* Payments (e.g. Stripe)
* Admin panel
* Product management UI
* Stock & inventory management
* Email notifications

These features are outside the scope of a Junior Frontend portfolio and would add unnecessary complexity.
